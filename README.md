In this project I created RESTful API for a blogging system that utilizes Sequelize as the ORM to connect to a MySQL database.
The schema includes complex associations, such as post categories and comments.
Users can create posts, categorize them, and leave comments. The API provides endpoints for managing users, posts, categories, and 
comments
